# Popular Algorithm Problems

This is a notebook that I use for storing the solutions of some of the famous algorithm problems. Solutions are in C++. To compile the source code, go to the directory where main.cpp is using terminal and type the following command (assuming you have a g++ as compiler):

```
g++ -std=c++20 -o run.o main.cpp
```

If you want to run the executable after successful compilation, again using terminal, type the following command

```
./run.o
```
